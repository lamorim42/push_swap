# push_swap

Push_swap is a project where we have to leave data in order using two stacks and allowed operations

## How to navagate in this repository

- [`include`](./include/) - The include file `push_swap.h`;
- [`library`](./library/) - The `libftprintf.a`
in [`ft_printf`](./library/ft_printf/);
- [`list`](./list/) - The list functions;
- [`rules`](./rules/) - The rules to manipulate stakcs
- [`src`](./src/) - source code;
- [`obj`](./obj/) - object files.
- [`Makefile`](./Makefile) - Makefile to compile `push_swap`;

## How I implemented push_swap

To implement the stack structure I used linked-list as data structure.
For that I build functions to manipulate the list and I used these functions
to build the functions that manipulate the stack according to the project rules.
